abstract={We continue to develop a new Superconductor Flux Logic (SFL) family based on nSQUID gates with fundamentally low energy dissipation and the ability to operate in irreversible and reversible modes. Prospective computers utilizing the new gates can keep conventional logically irreversible architectures. In this case the energy dissipation is limited by fundamental thermodynamic laws and could be as low as a few kBT s per logic operation. Highly exotic and less practical logically and physically reversible circuit architectures are more attractive for us because they enable a reduction of the specific energy dissipation well below the thermodynamic threshold kBTln2. The reversible option is of interest to us because we can then experimentally demonstrate that all technical mechanisms of the energy dissipation could be cut below the fundamental thermodynamic limit. In other words, we like to set the energy dissipation record for all conventional digital technologies that (if measured in kBT ) is about one million times below the best figures achieved in commercially available semiconductor circuits. Besides, we believe that diving below the thermodynamic threshold would have impressive scientific and philosophical impacts. In the paper we introduce a new timing belt clocking scheme and present new circuits. While we still work with test circuits, some of them contain two 8-stage shift registers, one with direct and the other with inverted outputs. The energy dissipation per nSQUID gate per bit measured at 4 K temperature is already below the thermodynamic threshold. We are confident that we passed through the critical phase of the project and we simply need more time to make more sophisticated circuits. The extremely low energy dissipation converts our circuits into a natural candidate to support circuitry for any sensors operating at milli-Kelvin temperatures.},

abstract={The study of reversible circuits holds great promise for emerging technologies. Reversible circuits offer the possibility for great reductions in power consumption, and quantum computers will require logically reversible digital circuits. Many different reversible implementations of logical and arithmetic units have been proposed in the literature, but very few reversible floating-point designs exist. Floating-point operations are needed very frequently in nearly all computing disciplines, and studies have shown floating-point addition to be the most oft used floating-point operation. In this paper we present for the first time a reversible floating-point adder that closely follows the IEEE754 specification for binary floating-point arithmetic. Our design requires reversible designs of a controlled swap unit, a subtracter, an alignment unit, signed integer representation conversion units, an integer adder, a normalization unit, and a rounding unit. We analyze these major components in terms of quantum cost, garbage outputs, and constant inputs.},

abstract={The circuits like Logic gates, Adders, Multipliers are the basic building block of the digital circuits. These combinational circuits can be designed by using the concepts of the reversible logic. The reversible logic is either a physically reversible or logically reversible. In this paper the combinational circuits are logically reversible. One of the applications of the reversible logic is Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA). QCA has attracted feature of extremely small feature size (at the molecular or even atomic scale) and its ultra-low power consumption, making it one candidate for replacing CMOS technology. Thus the design and realization of the Basic Logic gates and Combinational circuits like ripple carry adder, serial adder, multiplexer are done by using the concept of Quantum Cellular Automata. Also, the area and cost of the QCA system is reduced with the help of Coplanar architecture arrangement of cells. The paper is organized as follows; the section one gives the overall introduction about QCA, Clocking of QCA and Wires in QCA. Section two gives information about the basic logic gates. In Section three, design and Simulation of Combinational circuits like half adder, full adder, ripple carry adders and multipliers are discussed. At last the Comparison of Quantum cost of the above designs due to Coplanar architecture was elaborated.},

abstract={Reversible logic is a computational model where all gates are logically reversible and combined in circuits such that no values are lost or duplicated. This paper presents a novel functional language that is designed to describe only reversible logic circuits. The language includes high-level constructs such as conditionals and a let-in statement that can be used to locally change wires that are otherwise considered to be constant. Termination of recursion is restricted by size-change termination; it must be guaranteed that all recursive calls will be to a strictly smaller circuit size. Reversibility of descriptions is guaranteed with a type system based on linear types. The language is applied to three examples of reversible computations (ALU, linear cosine transformation, and binary adder). The paper also outlines a design flow that ensures garbage-free translation to reversible logic circuits. The flow relies on a reversible combinator language as an intermediate language.},

abstract={The usual general-purpose computing automaton (e.g., a Turing machine) is logically irreversible—its transition function lacks a single-valued inverse. Here it is shown that such machines may be made logically reversible at every step, while retaining their simplicity and their ability to do general computations. This result is of great physical interest because it makes plausible the existence of thermodynamically reversible computers which could perform useful computations at useful speed while dissipating considerably less than kT of energy per logical step. In the first stage of its computation the logically reversible automaton parallels the corresponding irreversible automaton, except that it saves all intermediate results, thereby avoiding the irreversible operation of erasure. The second stage consists of printing out the desired output. The third stage then reversibly disposes of all the undesired intermediate results by retracing the steps of the first stage in backward order (a process which is only possible because the first stage has been carried out reversibly), thereby restoring the machine (except for the now-written output tape) to its original condition. The final machine configuration thus contains the desired output and a reconstructed copy of the input, but no other undesired data. The foregoing results are demonstrated explicitly using a type of three-tape Turing machine. The biosynthesis of messenger RNA is discussed as a physical example of reversible computation.},

abstract={We present an approach to the cache bottleneck problem using reversible logic circuits. The high traffic between the cache and the main memory in current systems considerably slows down the performance of the general information processing unit (IPU). Moreover this high traffic has the consequence of high heat generation in VLSI elements such as the CPU or dedicated processors. Thus the reduction in use or complete removal of the cache memory could be beneficial to current processors architecture. We present a model where the IPU is designed as a logically reversible circuit. This allows one to reduce the cache memory traffic because data can be recovered using the output of the current processing. We illustrate the implementation of the approach by providing a design of an adiabatic reversible Toffoli gate with a power consumption equivalent to a classical adiabatic circuit. With these approaches, the cache-memory bottleneck and heat dissipation can potentially be reduced even by using only logically reversible circuit implementation.},

abstract={Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a new computation paradigm which encodes bit information by charge configurations. No current flows through the cells; only Coulomb interaction contributes to the computation. Power dissipation has become an important issue in nanotechnology because of the high densities in nano-devices. The chip will melt unless the device dissipates only a small amount of energy to the environment. Landauer (Landauer and Keyes, 1970) has proposed an adiabatic switching method, which has been applied widely in clocked QCA cells (Timler and Lent, 2003). Gradual clocking insures the cells always in the instantaneous ground state, which can provide arbitrarily low power dissipation if the switching process is slow enough. Nondissipative computation can be achieved by keeping a copy to the bits that are going to be erased (Timler and Lent, 2003). Bennett pointed out that any computation could be rendered into reversible format by accumulating a history of all information that would normally thrown away, then disposing this history by the reverse of the process that created it (Bennett, 2000). In this paper, we employ the Bennett clocking design in QCA circuits, which clocks the circuit forward through the cell array and then retreats the clock in a backward sequence. In conventional CMOS considerable overhead in circuit complexity is required to achieve Bennett clocking. In QCA by contrast, no additional circuit complexity is required - only a different clock signal. We show by direct calculation of the equations of motion for a QCA system that energy dissipation less than k/sub B/Tlog(2) is possible for logically irreversible systems using the Bennett clocking approach.},

pages={1350-1363},
abstract={Quantum computation can solve certain problems much faster than classical computation. However, quantum computations are more susceptible to errors than conventional digital computations. Thus, a fault-tolerant (FT) quantum circuit design is required for a practical implementation. Quantum circuits consist of a cascade of quantum gates. These gates are themselves realized using primitive quantum operations that are supported by the quantum physical machine description (PMD). As different quantum systems are associated with different Hamiltonians, they have different PMDs. In addition, the quantum cost for implementing a quantum operation may differ from one PMD to another. Thus, a quantum logic circuit needs to be realized with and optimized for the set of primitive quantum operations supported by the given PMD. In this paper, an FT quantum logic synthesis (FTQLS) methodology and tool is described for six different PMDs. A methodology, such as this, which can be targeted at multiple PMDs, has not been attempted before, to the best of our knowledge. The input to FTQLS is an unoptimized quantum circuit realized using a set of commonly used gates and its output is an optimized FT quantum circuit that only comprises of primitive quantum operations supported by the given PMD. FTQLS does technology mapping for different PMDs and then converts non-FT circuits to FT circuits. For technology mapping, it utilizes an optimized quantum gate library targeted at various PMDs that decomposes gates into primitive operations. Efficient conversion to FT circuits is done by integrating two quantum compilers and an FT cache table into FTQLS. For improving the synthesis results, an FT set of gates that is directly supported by each PMD is proposed. Quantum circuit optimization is done by utilizing quantum identity rules. The performance of FTQLS is evaluated using two cost metrics: number of primitive operations (#ops) and execution cycles on the critical path (#cycles). Experiment res- lts show that the decrease in #ops varies between 58.1% and 87.0% and in #cycles between 42.8% and 76.4%, on an average, depending on the PMD.},

abstract={Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of coherent feedback quantum control, the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system, has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum systems, called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems, from basic quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way. The synthesis theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for applications beyond the realization of coherent quantum feedback controllers. In earlier work, Nurdin et al. have established that an arbitrary linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators, together with a direct interaction Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of the oscillators. However, from an experimental perspective and based on current methods and technologies, direct interaction Hamiltonians are challenging to implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom. In order to facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems, this technical note develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that relies solely on field-mediated interactions, including in implementation of the direct interaction Hamiltonian. Explicit synthesis examples are provided to illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic systems using the new algorithm.},

abstract={Quantum circuits consist of a cascade of quantum gates. In a physical design-unaware quantum logic circuit, a gate is assumed to operate on an arbitrary set of quantum bits (qubits), without considering the physical location of the qubits. However, in reality, physical qubits have to be placed on a grid. Each node of the grid represents a qubit. The grid implements the architecture of the quantum computer. A physical constraint often imposed is that quantum gates can only operate on adjacent qubits on the grid. Hence, a communication channel needs to be built if the qubits in the logical circuit are not adjacent. In this paper, we introduce a tool called the physical design-aware fault-tolerant quantum circuit synthesis (PAQCS). It contains two algorithms: one for physical qubit placement and another for routing of communications. With the help of these two algorithms, the overhead of converting a logical to a physical circuit is reduced by 30.1%, on an average, relative to previous work. The optimization algorithms in PAQCS are evaluated on circuits implemented using quantum operations supported by two different quantum physical machine descriptions and three quantum error-correcting codes. They reduce the number of primitive operations by 11.5%–68.6%, and the number of execution cycles by 16.9%–59.4%.},

abstract={We propose an approach to optimally synthesize quantum circuits from non-permutative quantum gates such as controlled-square-root-of-not (i.e., controlled-V). Our approach reduces the synthesis problem to multiple-valued optimization and uses group theory. We devise a novel technique that transforms the quantum logic synthesis problem from a multi-valued constrained optimization problem to a group permutation problem. The transformation enables us to utilize group theory to exploit the properties of the synthesis problem. Assuming a cost of one for each two-qubit gate, we find all reversible circuits with quantum costs of 4, 5, 6, etc, and give another algorithm to realize these reversible circuits with quantum gates.},
