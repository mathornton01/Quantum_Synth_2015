abstract={An ESOP-based Toffoli gate cascade synthesis algorithm is presented. The algorithm is capable of generating a cascade of reversible gates for logic functions with large numbers of qubits. The algorithm is fast as it uses a simple cost metric heuristic during a recursive divide-and-conquer function to determine NOT and Toffoli gate placement.},
