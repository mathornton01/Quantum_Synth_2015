\section{problem definition}
There are a number of classical circuits that benefit from the property of being a mathematical bijection. For instance a hash function necessarily needs
to be a mathematical bijection in order to ensure there are no collisions in the mapping from inputs to hash outputs. 
Unfortunately, <computationally efficient> methods do not currently exist to determine if a circuit is in fact a bijection.
We propose the implementation of a software synthesis tool based on current work in the literature to determine if a classical circuit is a mathematical bijection.
If this circuit is synthesizable as a quantum cascade with no garbage outputs and no ancillia inputs then we know the circuit is logically reversible and is a bijection.
