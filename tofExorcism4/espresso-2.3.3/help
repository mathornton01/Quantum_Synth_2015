NAME
     espresso - Boolean Minimization

SYNOPSIS
     espresso [_o_p_t_i_o_n_s] [_f_i_l_e]

DESCRIPTION
     _E_s_p_r_e_s_s_o takes as input  a  two-level  representation  of  a
     two-valued  (or  multiple-valued) Boolean function, and pro-
     duces a minimal equivalent representation.   The  algorithms
     used  are  new  and  represent  an advance in both speed and
     optimality of solution in heuristic Boolean minimization.

     _E_s_p_r_e_s_s_o reads the _f_i_l_e provided (or standard  input  if  no
     files  are specified), performs the minimization, and writes
     the minimized result to standard output.  _E_s_p_r_e_s_s_o automati-
     cally  verifies that the minimized function is equivalent to
     the original function.  Options allow  for  using  an  exact
     minimization   algorithm,  for  choosing  an  optimal  phase
     assignment for the output functions,  and  for  choosing  an
     optimal assignment of the inputs to input decoders.

     The default input and output  file  formats  are  compatible
     with  the Berkeley standard format for the physical descrip-
     tion of a PLA.  The input format is described in  detail  in
     espresso(5).    Note  that  the  input  file  is  a  _l_o_g_i_c_a_l
     representation of a set of Boolean equations, and hence  the
     input  format differs slightly from that described in pla(5)
     (which provides for the _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l representation of  a  PLA).
     The input and output formats have been expanded to allow for
     multiple-valued  logic  functions,  and  to  allow  for  the
     specification  of  the  don't-care set which will be used in
     the minimization.

     A complete list of the command line options is given  below.
     Be  warned  that  many  of  the command line options are not
     intended for general use.

     -d        Enables debugging.  Useful only for those familiar
               with the algorithms used.

     -Dcheck   Checks that the function is  a  partition  of  the
               entire  space  (i.e., that the ON-set, OFF-set and
               DC-set are pairwise disjoint, and that their union
               is the Universe).

     -Dd1merge Performs a quick distance-1  merge  on  the  input
               file.   This is useful when the input file is very
               large (e.g., a truth table  with  more  than  1000
               terms)  because  distance-1  merge  is  O(n log n)
               rather than the EXPAND step of Espresso  which  is
               O(n  *  n).  The output should then be run through

               Espresso to complete the minimization.  A range of
               variables to be merged can also be specified using
               -rn-m (the default is  to  merge  over  all  vari-
               ables).

     -Decho    Echoes the function to standard output.  This  can
               be  used  to get the complement of a function when
               combined with -o.

     -Dequiv   Identify output variables  which  are  equivalent.
               Takes  into  account the don't-care set and checks
               for equivalence of both the ON-set and OFF-set.

     -Dexact   Exact minimization algorithm  (guarantees  minimum
               number  of product terms, and heuristically minim-
               izes number of literals).  Potentially expensive.

     -Dmany    Reads and minimizes  PLA's  until  end-of-file  is
               detected.  PLA's in the same file are separated by
               ._e.

     -Dmap     Draw the Karnaugh maps for a  binary-valued  func-
               tion.

     -Dmapdc   Derive from the binary-valued variable _D_O_N_T__C_A_R_E a
               don't-care  set,  and  then  delete this variable.
               All input conditions for which an  output  changes
               when  _D_O_N_T__C_A_R_E changes define the don't-care con-
               ditions for that output.  This is a hack  to  sup-
               port don't-cares from high-level languages without
               a notion of don't-cares.

     -Dopo     Perform output phase optimization (i.e., determine
               which functions to complement to reduce the number
               of terms needed to implement the function).  After
               choosing  an assignment of phases for the outputs,
               the function is minimized.  A simple algorithm  is
               used  which  may become very expensive for a large
               number of outputs (e.g., more than 40).

     -Dopoall  Minimize the  function  with  all  possible  phase
               assignments.   A range of outputs to cycle through
               can be given with -rn-m (the default is to use all
               outputs).   The  option  -S1 will perform an exact
               minimization for each phase assignment.  Be warned
               that  opoall  requires  an  exponential  number of
               minimizations !

     -Dpair    Choose an assignment  of  the  inputs  to  two-bit
               decoders, and minimize the function.  The function
               MUST be minimized first to achieve  good  results.
               There  are  actually  4  different  algorithms, of

               increasing cost, which may be selected  with  -S1,
               -S2,  or  -S3.   The default is -S0 which seems to
               give the best results for the cost.

     -Dpairall Minimize the function with  all  possible  assign-
               ments  of  inputs to two-bit decoders.  The option
               -S1 will perform an exact  minimization  for  each
               assignment  of  inputs to decoders, and the option
               -S2 will perform an  output-phase  assignment  for
               each  assignment of inputs to decoders.  Be warned
               that pairall requires  an  exponential  number  of
               minimizations !

     -Dseparate
               Remove the don't-care set from the ON-set  of  the
               function.

     -Dso      Minimize each function one at a time as a  single-
               output  function.   Terms will not be shared among
               the functions.  The option  -S1  will  perform  an
               exact  minimization  for  each single-output func-
               tion.

     -Dso_both Minimize each function one at a time as a  single-
               output  function,  but  choose the function or its
               complement based on which has  fewer  terms.   The
               option  -S1 will perform an exact minimization for
               each single-output function and its complement  to
               determine which has fewer terms.

     -Dstats   Provide simple statistics on the size of the func-
               tion.

     -Dverify  Checks  for  Boolean  equivalence  of  two  PLA's.
               Reads  two  filenames  from the command line, each
               containing a single PLA.

     -DPLAverify
               Checks for Boolean equivalence  of  two  PLA's  by
               first permuting the columns based on the user sup-
               plied variable names.  Reads  two  filenames  from
               the command line.

     -eeat     Normally comments are echoed from the  input  file
               to  the  output  file.   This options discards any
               comments in the input file.

     -efast    Stop after the first EXPAND and IRREDUNDANT opera-
               tions (i.e., do not iterate over the solution).

     -ekiss    Sets up a _k_i_s_s-style minimization  problem.   This
               is a hack.

     -eness    Essential primes will not be detected.

     -enirr    The result will not necessarily be  made  irredun-
               dant  in  the  final  step which removes redundant
               literals.

     -enunwrap The ON-set will not be unwrapped before  beginning
               the minimization.

     -eonset   Recompute  the  ON-set  before  the  minimization.
               Useful  when the PLA has a large number of product
               terms (e.g., an exhaustive list of minterms).

     -epos     Swaps the ON-set and OFF-set of the function after
               reading  the function.  This can be used to minim-
               ize  the  OFF-set  of  a  function.   ._p_h_a_s_e  (see
               espresso(5)) in the input file can also specify an
               arbitrary choice of output phases.

     -estrong  Uses  the  alternate  strategy  SUPER_GASP  (as  a
               replacement  for  LAST_ GASP) which is more expen-
               sive, but occasionally provides better results.

     -o[type]  Selects the output format.  By default,  only  the
               ON-set  (i.e., type f) is output after the minimi-
               zation.  [type] can be one of f, d, r, fd, dr, fr,
               or  fdr  to  select  any combination of the ON-set
               (f), the OFF-set (r) or the  DC-set  (d).   [type]
               may  also be eqntott to output algebraic equations
               acceptable to _e_q_n_t_o_t_t(1CAD), or pleasure to output
               an  unmerged  PLA (with the ._l_a_b_e_l and ._g_r_o_u_p key-
               words) acceptable to _p_l_e_a_s_u_r_e(1CAD).

     -s        Will provide a short summary of the  execution  of
               the  program  including  the  initial  cost of the
               function,  the  final  cost,  and   the   computer
               resources used.

     -t        Will produce a trace showing the execution of  the
               program.  After each main step of the algorithm, a
               single line is printed which reports the processor
               time used, and the current cost of the function.

     -x        Suppress printing of the solution.

     -v [type] Specifies verbose debugging detail.  Not generally
               useful.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Espresso will issue a warning  message  if  a  product  term
     spans  more  than  one  line.  Usually this is an indication
     that the number of inputs or  outputs  of  the  function  is

COMMENTS
     Default is to pass comments and  unrecognized  options  from
     the input file to standard output (sometimes this isn't what
     you want).

     It is no longer possible to specify the type on the  command
     line.

     There are a lot of options, but  typical  use  doesn't  need
     them.

     This manual page refers to Version  2.3  of  Espresso.   The
     major change from Version 2.2 to Version 2.3 is the addition
     of a fast sparse-matrix covering algorithm for  the  -Dexact
     mode.

     The -Dopo option becomes very slow for many outputs (> 20).
